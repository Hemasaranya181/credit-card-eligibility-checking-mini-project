## Credit Card Eligibility Checking – Mini Project

This project checks whether a user is eligible for a credit card based on age, annual income, and credit score. Developed in C, it uses simple conditional logic to give a clear decision of “Eligible” or “Not Eligible.” Ideal for beginners learning decision-making in C programming.
